# CPE-313 Final Project Segmentation
This project aims to develop an accurate fire detection system through instance segmentation of fire images using a specialized dataset from Roboflow, enhancing early fire detection and safety monitoring applications.

I implemented and trained three state-of-the-art deep learning models for instance segmentation:

**YOLOv11** – a recent version of the well-known YOLO object detection framework enhanced for instance segmentation.

**YOLOv8** – the latest version of YOLO providing improved precision and speed.

**Mask R-CNN** – a reliably recognized two-phase detector known for excellent instance segmentation quality.
    
Every model underwent training and assessment using the identical dataset to evaluate performance regarding accuracy, speed, and segmentation quality.

**About Me**

I am Angelo Ballesteros, a Computer Engineering student at the Technological Institute of the Philippines – Quezon City (TIP QC). This project was completed as part of the requirements for CPE313 Data Science Track Elective 3, focusing on applying machine and deep learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
